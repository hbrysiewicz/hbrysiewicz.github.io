For the July 2014 SanDiego.js speaker Meetup I gave a lightning talk on <a href="https://github.com/trek/pretender">Pretender</a>, a mock server microlibrary written by <a href="https://twitter.com/trek">@trek</a>. Its much lighter than its counterparts and easy to get up and running with fast. In my opinion, the server DSL looks similar to express. All of the examples are done with Ember.js.

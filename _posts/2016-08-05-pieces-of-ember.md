At the July monthly <a href="http://sandiegojs.org/">SanDiego.js</a> event I gave a quick lightning talk about the different pieces of [Ember][ember] that can be used outside of the Ember ecosystem. As a follow up, I am also doing a three part series on the topic through the [DockYard Blog][part1]. The first part covers in full RSVP and Broccoli, while the remaining parts will cover routing and templating.

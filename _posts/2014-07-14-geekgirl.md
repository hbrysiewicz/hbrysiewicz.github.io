<a href="http://sandiegojs.org/">SanDiego.js</a> happily participated in <a href="http://sandiego.geekgirltechcon.com/">Geek Girl Tech Conference</a> again this year in July. I was asked to provide an "Introduction to JavaScript" session and had some fun putting it together as well as presenting it. The crowd experience was mostly beginners or no-programming-experience-at-all-ers, but there were some other presenters in attendance as well.

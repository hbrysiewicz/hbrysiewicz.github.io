I am finally getting around to setting up my own blog. I feel that far too often I find myself working on something that would be useful to reference or that may make someone else's developing life a bit easier. My hesitation has been partly due to time commitment as well as quality of posts but I've accepted I won't get better at posting unless I try.

As an introduction post I don't want to get technical. I'm currently working as a JavaScript developer in the San Diego area. I used to attend the EmberJS Meetups in Chicago religiously and have recently become a Co-Organizer of the SanDiego.js Meetup group here.

In the process of working on my presentation for <a href="http://qconsf.com/presentation/ember-enterprise-application-framework">QConSF</a> I pulled out some styling from the official <a href="http://emberjs.com">Ember.js</a> website and created a theme for <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/">Reveal.js</a> out of it.

I really enjoy using <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/">Reveal.js</a> for my presentations because it allows me to display code side-by-side with working or interactive examples. It also allows me to easily embed media and work in a format that I am familiar with. It is also extremely convenient to host and share the slides through github pages, allowing me to provide this url to atendees or others that may wish to reference it later.

So, enjoy!

The image referred to for the body background I saved from <a href="http://emberjs.com/images/background-shades.svg">here</a> and I popped it in the `img` directory within my reveal project.
